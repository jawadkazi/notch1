        <h2>A heuristic algorithm for predicting functional impact of NOTCH1 mutations in cancer.</h2>

          <p>
NOTCH1 is an evolutionarily conserved gene encoding a transmembrane receptor involved in
development and cell fate decisions, which is also frequently mutated in human cancer. In Leukemia
NOTCH1 acts as an oncogene due to activating mutations; whereas in solid squamous carcinomas of the
head and neck, skin, esophagus, or lung NOTCH1 is a tumor suppressor and mutations are thought to be
inactivating. Structurally, the human NOTCH1 gene encodes a 2501 amino acid protein with well
defined discrete domains, including 36 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, a heterodimerization
region (HD), a transmembrane (TM) region, RAM, Ankyrin (ANK), TAD, and C-terminal PEST domains. We
and others have reported that human Leukemias and solid squamous carcinomas have distinct and non-
overlapping patterns of NOTCH1 mutations consistent with its dual function of either oncogene or
tumor suppressor. More recently, our group discovered that head and neck cancer cell lines harboring
inactivating NOTCH1 mutations were uniquely sensitive to clinical drugs targeting the PI3K pathway,
which led to opening the first genomic biomarker-driven human clinical in head and neck cancer
(NCT03740100). In the trial, patients identified as having a potentially inactivating NOTCH1 mutation
were treated with the PI3K inhibitor Bimiralisib. Because NOTCH1 is a tumor suppressor in head and
neck cancers, it is frequently difficult to predict whether point mutations found in patient tumors are
truly inactivating when the mutations donâ€™t prematurely truncate the protein. To have a more
consistent way of determining patient eligibility for the Bimiralisib trial and predict if NOTCH1 mutations
are inactivating, we developed a heuristic NOTCH1 mutation caller algorithm. Using the specific cDNA
codon sequences for the human NOTCH1 gene we calculated all possible point mutations and their SIFT
or PROVEAN scores to drive the theoretical probability of observing a damaging point mutation in each
of the different NOTCH1 domains. Next we utilized historical TCGA data for more than 100 different
NOTCH1 mutations observed in tumors from patients with cancers of the head and neck, esophagus,
and lung to examine the distribution of mutations with damaging SIFT or PROVEAN scores across each
NOTCH1 domain to look for non-random enrichment. The binomial formula was used to determine the
probability of observed outcomes (damaging mutations) and identify specific NOTCH1 domains likely
selected for during cancer development as opposed to domains where mutations likely happened by
chance. Applying the same principal to over 500 NOTCH1 mutations observed for Leukemia, we were
able to construct a heuristic truth table to predict the likelihood that a new point mutation would fall
into the category of inactivating (i.e. tumor suppressor) verses activating (i.e. oncogene). For alterations
that were not point mutations, such as frameshifts, theoretical probabilities for observed events were
calculated with a Poisson distribution to similarly find regions where mutations were non-random. To
facilitate prediction for functional consequences of NOTCH1 mutations we developed a Python script
based NOTCH1 caller algorithm that allows users to input an observed NOTCH1 mutation in HGVS
format and the program maps the mutation to its specified domain and outputs a prediction regarding
function based on the heuristically built truth table along with patient eligibility for our clinical trial.</p>
